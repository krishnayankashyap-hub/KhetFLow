🌾 KhetFlow(Deployed - click the link given below to check the portals)

From Farm Waste to Market Value. From Surplus Stock to Business Profit.
KhetFlow is a B2B platform transforming "imperfect" produce into opportunities for farmers and affordable resources for businesses. We bridge the gap between waste and value.

💡 The Problem
The System is Broken. Every year, ₹92,000 Crores worth of produce is wasted. Millions of tons of fresh fruits and vegetables are discarded not because they are bad, but simply because they look different (Grade B/C).

-Farmers face massive income loss and rotting crops.
-Businesses (Hotels, Restaurants) struggle to find affordable, reliable supplies and often hunt for these "imperfect" goods in night markets to cut costs.

"I have seen this myself in the field: businesses trying to find Grade B or C produce that tastes the same but looks different, often late at night. Why not make it easy for them and profitable for the farmers?"


🚀 The Solution
KhetFlow is a B2B operations platform connecting farmers holding imperfect produce directly to local commercial kitchens and retailers. We provide a "moat" against risk with trusted logistics and payments.

-Win-Win: Farmers sell surplus stock; Businesses increase profits by 30-40% by sourcing affordable raw materials.
-Sustainability: We judge food by nutrition and freshness, not appearance


✨ Key Features
📸 Easy Listings: Farmers can upload photos, set prices, and grade their produce (Grade A/B/C) in minutes.

🛒 Smart Orders: Businesses can browse live inventory, place orders, and track deliveries in real-time.
🚚 Agri-Rider Logistics: A gig-economy network of local "Agri-Riders" (tempo/truck drivers) handles all pickups and deliveries.
⚡ Flash Sales: Quick-sell options for perishable produce that needs to move immediately.
🔍 QR Code Trust: Every crate features a QR code verifying its farm origin for 100% transparency.
💸 Instant Payments: 90% of the payment is credited immediately to the Farmer and Rider upon delivery confirmation.
📱 Multi-Portal Ecosystem: Dedicated dashboards for Farmers, Buyers, and Riders.


🛠️ Tech Stack
We utilize a "Firebase-First" stack for real-time scalability.
-Frontend: React (Vite), HTML, CSS, JavaScript
-Backend: Firebase (Realtime Database, Authentication, Cloud Functions)
-Deployment: Firebase Hosting
-Tools: VS Code, Git

Dispatch: Local "Agri-Riders" receive pickup/delivery details via the app.
Verify: Buyers scan the QR code upon arrival to verify quality.
Payout: Smart contracts trigger instant payments to the Farmer and Rider.


🔮 Future Roadmap
Phase 1: Expand pilot to 10 farmers & 3 restaurants in Gauhati.
Phase 2: AI-based quality prediction and automated pricing.
Phase 3: IoT sensors for real-time produce monitoring during transit.
Phase 4: Blockchain integration for immutable supply chain transparency.
